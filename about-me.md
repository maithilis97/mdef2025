# About me

Hey! I am Maithili, welcome to my archive of explorations!&#x20;

I am from Mumbai, India and that's where I have spent most of my life. Though I have travelled a fair bit, this is my first time living away from home for longer than a month, but Barcelona is growing on me very fast haha :)

On a personal front, I love to draw, listen to music (a sucker for Indian classical music), travel and drink tea. I have a _Visharad_ degree in an Indian classical dance form called _Bharatnatyam._ One day, I would love to have my own farm with rescue animals and a nice little farmhouse!

Professionally, I am an architect. I have my studio and practice based in Mumbai since the past four years. I have worked on a variety of projects including architecture, interior design, furniture design, &#x20;
