# Design Intervention

This week, I undertook my first design intervention around the idea of what heritage means to me. Heritage is a very large term which can include a variety of things and has a subjective meaning. I wished to understand what heritage means in my own context and my sense of identity.&#x20;

As a first step to understanding how i define my own heritage, I decided to reflect on the things I have here that connect to my personal heritage - both tangible and intangible. Amongst everything I have with me, quite a few objects are connected to my personal or cultural heritage. Some, I have brought with me intentionally while others are absolutely non-negotiable. My strongly feel my sense of identity is deeply rooted in these little objects and practices, which are representations of a much larger network of systems and practices.
