Collective Intervention : Build your own natureculture
{% endembed %}

## Process&#x20;

The process with brainstorming about how our potential areas of interest overlap. As a group, we were interested in exploring natureculture, heritage and symbiosis. Understanding these concepts not only in our context but also as a collective. After much brainstorming, we designed an interactive game that people can play to design their version of an ideal future culture. With some initial inputs from our side as options to choose from, every person who played the game would have to add something to the mix, making it a growing archive. The initial inputs included rituals, practices, building techniques and tools from different parts of the world with a strong natural and cultural ties with respective contexts.&#x20;

**Components**&#x20;

1. Central hexagon : Categories of Society&#x20;

The hexagon is the staring point of the game as a reference to start building your own culture. It is broadly divided into six categories that loosely contribute to the making of a culture. The player can   use these to categorize the options and place them where they think it fits best.&#x20;

2. The triangles&#x20;

The triangular cards include details about vernacular practices, rituals, building techniques, tools and materials from around the world that could be used to create a 'sustainable' future for different reasons. The player can pick any of these triangles and place them next to the hexagon where they see fit. There are no rules as to how many a player can pick or place. The only rule is after making their unique combination, every player has to add their own triangle to the mix. This ensures that the game grows with every interaction.&#x20;
