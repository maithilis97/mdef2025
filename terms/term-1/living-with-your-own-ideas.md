  This week, we explored the idea of prostheses and its interpretations. With
  readings from some interesting authors, we were able to define the protheses
  for ourselves based on different prompts.

# Living with your own ideas

## Day 1 : Becoming the best version of myself

The first day started with Saul explaining the week long exercise. We discussed in class about what it means to have a prostheses and what counts as in. Medical devices, make up, clothes, accessories? Or is it concepts - like societal standards ? We are all putting on a variety of prostheses, both tangible and intangible throughout the day to 'perform'.&#x20;

The first prompt was making a prosthesis about becoming the best version of myself. Upon contemplating what that means for me, I realized the one thing I would like to modify about myself is the fact that I have to wear glasses to correct my vision. What if glasses could be more than just correcting vision? What if I could manually focus on things that I am interested in?&#x20;

Imagine this :&#x20;

Youre living in the hustle and bustle of the city, with traffic and a rush to get somewhere. You wake up ever morning, with a clear routine in mind, getting ready and going to work. There's an urgency to reach places on time and you forget to take a pause. Nature is but a background in your daily life and you forget to acknowledge that you could also engage with it.&#x20;

But, you now have your binocular glasses and things start to change. You can now focus on things you normally wouldn't focus on. Like trees, leaves, clouds, birds in the sky. On your commute, you can adjust your focus and take a closer look at the finer things in life. Suddenly, your life is filled with little moments that allow you to engage with nature.

Its interesting to think how our daily prosthesis have the potential to be so much more. Reimagining our daily use case could extend our abilities as humans. I believe becoming the best version of myself would be using my weakness as an opportunity to explore things that could potentially become my strengths.&#x20;

## Day 2 : Becoming someone else&#x20;

The second day began with an amazing interaction with Thomas Thwaites where he shared some projects. The projects included the making of a toaster and exploring the idea of being more than human - a goat. He explained his inspirations, motivations behind the projects and the intensity of its process. One thing that both his projects had in common was the steadfast commitment during the process and being okay with uncomfortable situations that come up when you explore things in the first person perspective. Following the talk, we collectively read an excerpt from Thomas Thwaites' book about his project 'Goatman' and from Donna Haraway's 'The Companion Species Manifesto'. The readings became food for thought for our prompt that followed.&#x20;

The second prompt for a prosthesis was becoming someone else. It could be interpreted in multiple ways but the intention was to become non-human. Taking inspiration from nature and the chameleon, I used the colour changing ability to be used in my prosthesis. How would it be if we could have the ability to emote without speaking? Would it make having vulnerable conversations easier? Would wearing something that reflects your true feelings create safer spaces and a world without judgments?&#x20;

The prosthesis is a second skin which can be worn as a sleeve. The sleeve would simulate colours that are associated with different emotions to indicate my state of mind. This prostheses would be a part of a network of similar prostheses worn by other people. Apart from indicating my own feelings, it would also make it easier to assess other people's emotions and ease conversations, especially in new contexts.&#x20;

Reflecting on my own transition from India to Barcelona a month back, the process of getting acquainted will a completely new set of people is nerve wracking. It takes time to for people to move past the ice breaking stage and form meaningful friendships. I would like to believe that having this prosthesis would have eased the transition.   &#x20;

This is imagined as a prototype but could also come in different versions, some more discreet than others.&#x20;
