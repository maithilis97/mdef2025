  This week, we explored the idea of prostheses and its interpretations. With
  readings from some interesting authors, we were able to define the protheses
  for ourselves based on different prompts.

# Living with your own ideas

**Day 1 : Becoming the best version of myself**&#x20;

The first day started with Saul explaining the week long exercise. We discussed in class about what it means to have a prostheses and what counts as in. Medical devices, make up, clothes, accessories? Or is it concepts - like societal standards ? We are all putting on a variety of prostheses, both tangible and intangible throughout the day to 'perform'.&#x20;

The first prompt was making a prosthesis about becoming the best version of myself. Upon contemplating what that means for me, I realized the one thing I would like to modify about myself is the fact that I have to wear glasses to correct my vision. What if glasses could be more than just correcting vision? What if I could manually focus on things that I am interested in?&#x20;
