# Documenting Design

Building your own website is something I thought only programmers do. It was a skill I did not have. So when Pablo introduced us to various ways of making a website, I thought it was such a great opportunity to learn. This is not only useful here, but also in the future!&#x20;

When i first used Gitbook, it was so refreshingly simple to use. That was my first impression. But the more I started to use it, I started noticing its limitations. One thing that bothers me most is the fact that I cannot change the font styles or size. There are limitations on which colors I can use, barring only a few. But, more than building the website, I though it was better to focus on making the content that goes on the website. Since everything I am doing at IAAC is new and exciting, I thought it made sense to atleast keep my website very clean and easy to use.&#x20;

But it would be really nice to explore Notion to make my website. Currently trying to figure out when that would be possible, may or may not be this year :)&#x20;

For now, I am liking the easy of operation Gitbook offers, and I am learning to navigate its limitations.
