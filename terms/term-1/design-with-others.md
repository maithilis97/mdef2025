  This week was about interacting with people whose practices are refreshingly
  different from what I had ever seen before. It was a week where a lot of my

# Design with Others

Faculty : Laura Benitez

***

## Day 1 : Dr. Marta Delatte

On the first day, Dr. Marta Delatte was invited to give a guest lecture for the class, where she introduced a complex discussion about design justice. From simple things like emojis, for example, simplify communication but fail to represent cultural diversity adequately, while **Wikipedia** highlights issues of representation, with 90% of contributors identifying as male, leading to gender-biased content.&#x20;

She discussed the issues with data extraction, emphasizing how it simplifies complex identities into mere data points, creating a systematic approach that claims to define populations, cultures, or individuals. This process often ends up reinforcing existing power imbalances. She argued that accountability shouldn't be an afterthought at the end of the design process but should be integrated throughout, ensuring that the voices of those most affected are genuinely heard and considered.

Through the discussion, I was trying to understand to what extent does 'inclusivity' be emphasized? The topics we dealt with area like an endless unravelling of details which require new found attention to a point of madness. When we discuss things like inclusivity, another thing that comes with it is offense. In a world thats just waiting to be offended, how do we navigate the delicacy of people's identities and foster an environment that's truly just?

Dr. Delatte then introduced the idea of the Matrix of Domination, a framework developed by Patricia Hill Collins for examining oppression and privilege in a wholistic way.

*   &#x20;**Structural Domain**

    ***

    Represents power embedded in institutions (law, politics, religion, and economics).
*   &#x20;**Disciplinary Domain**

    ***

    Focuses on bureaucratic control mechanisms, including rules and regulations that dictate behavior.
*   &#x20;**Hegemonic Domain**

    ***

    Relates to cultural ideologies and norms, shaping how people think about societal values.
*   &#x20;**Interpersonal Domain**

    ***

    Examines personal relationships and micro-level interactions that reflect broader power structures.

We then did a group exercise, where we used this framework to address an issue that we had identified and discussed it with others in class.&#x20;
