# Agriculture Zero

Faculty : Jonathan Minchin&#x20;

***



This course provided a quick yet insightful introduction to the world of agriculture, biological systems, ecology, and how we as humans fit into the picture. It was brief but definitely made me curious about the systems and techniques we discussed.&#x20;

On the first day, we covered fundamental concepts about forests and natural ecosystems. We also received a variety of reading materials and took part in a brief tour to explore the urban gardens in the Poblenou neighborhood.

The most interesting part of the seminar was the field trip to Valldaura labs, where we went for a day . On the way there, we came across a variety of plants and Jonathan gave us information and fun facts about everything we stumbled upon on the way. It was an interesting exercise and felt so good to get away from our classroom for a lecture! We also used the iNaturalist app to identify species of plants, fungi amongst other things.&#x20;

Once we went to Valldaura, we learnt about the way they grow their crops, the permaculture they use, their greenhouse, and soil less systems they use.&#x20;
