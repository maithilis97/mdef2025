I have been working on developing a framework to asses objects or materials based on how much we know about them. I tried to apply it to the objects that I already own/have at my place. &#x20;

1. **Origins & Traceability (Where does it come from?)**   \
   Geographic Context: Where is this material found? Is it region-specific or widespread?   \
   Natural vs. Processed: Is it raw or has it undergone transformation before use?   \
   Sourcing Methods: How is this material traditionally obtained? Is it sustainably or ethically sourced?   \
   Clay from Barcelona vs. clay from another part of Spain—how does location impact its properties and cultural use?
2. **Cultural & Historical Context (What stories does it carry?)**   \
   Traditional Uses: How has this material been used historically in different cultures?   \
   Artisanal Knowledge: Are there specific communities or craftspeople associated with this material?   \
   Symbolism & Meaning: Does this material hold cultural, spiritual, or political significance?   \
   Clay in Catalonia being used in traditional ceramics vs. its role in indigenous pottery in India—how do these histories differ?
3. **Making Process & Craftsmanship (How is it shaped?)**   \
   Transformation Process: What techniques are used to work with this material?   \
   Role of the Maker: Is the process driven by human skill, industrial production, or both?   \
   Imperfections & Uniqueness: Does the making process embrace irregularities or aim for perfection?   \
   Hand-shaped clay tiles vs. factory-produced tiles—how does craftsmanship affect perception and value?
4. **Sensory & Experiential Qualities (How do we experience it?)**   \
   Tactile Qualities: How does it feel, smell, or change with time?   \
   Emotional Connection: Does interacting with the material evoke memories, nostalgia, or certain emotions?   \
   Material Storytelling: Can the material tell a story through its texture, marks, or transformation over time?   \
   A handmade clay pot that carries fingerprints vs. a mass-produced ceramic bowl—how does the sensory experience differ?
5. **Personal & Collective Heritage (What does it mean to me/us?)**   \
   Personal Connection: What is your relationship with this material? Did you grow up with it? Have you worked with it before?   \
   Local vs. Global Identity: Does this material tie into your own cultural identity or belong to a shared global heritage?   \
   Evolving Narratives: How can this material’s heritage be preserved, adapted, or reinterpreted for the future?   \
   Your personal journey of collecting and processing clay—how does this become part of your own heritage and the evolving story of the material?
