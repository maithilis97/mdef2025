### A conversation with ChatGPT

### &#x20;

**You said:**

I have a design/innovation project that Iâ€™d like to describe more compellingly, and I need your help to do so. Start by asking me five thoughtful questions about my project, one at a time, in separate messages. Wait for my response to each question before asking the next one. These questions should aim to uncover important aspects of my project, such as its purpose, audience, uniqueness, impact, and practical details. Based on my answers, create a concise project definition, no longer than 1000 words, written in a friendly and easy-to-understand tone. Once the project definition is complete, help me define my projectâ€™s purpose using Simon Sinek's Golden Circle framework: First, ask questions to clarify What the project does. Then, ask questions to understand How the project does it. Finally, ask questions to uncover Why the project exists.

**ChatGPT said:**

Great! Letâ€™s start uncovering the key aspects of your project. Hereâ€™s my first question:

1\. What problem does your project aim to solve, and why is this problem important?



**You said:**

Okay the intention of the project is to understand materials that we as designers use but in a larger context. Not looking at the material purely as a tool to make something mass produced and utilitarian but rather, understand the geography, context, culture and heritage of the material. Its lifecycle, where it comes from, how is it sourced, what is its history, how has it been used historically, what is the cultural context of it etc. My project aims at understanding larger topics like heritage using materials as a way to talk about it, while trying to appreciate the process and effort of making an object, rather than the outcome. Its about embracing the imperfections of the process and let it be reflected in the outcome, which I think is what adds value - both emotional and in the practical sense



**ChatGPT said:**

Thatâ€™s a fascinating and thoughtful approach! Now, letâ€™s dig deeper:

2\. Who is your target audience, and how do you envision them engaging with your project?



**You said:**

I think starting with the target audience of designers but eventually this research could be applicable to anyone who wants to be bio materially aware. Engaging people with stories around things, that explain its process origins or makes people ask questions out of curiosity would be amazing. The reference that i use is a project by Sissel Tolas, its called What if we could smell the past? I think its a really nice way to understanding the history and context of not just objects but also materials

**ChatGPT said:**

Thatâ€™s a great way to frame your audienceâ€”starting with designers but expanding to a broader group of material-conscious individuals. Now for the next question:

3\. What makes your project unique compared to other material research or sustainability-focused initiatives?



**You said:**

I don't imagine my research to be preaching about what or how to use sustainable materials. Its more about starting conversations about the journey of the materials and process of the objects that people engage in. Its also not about proposing alternative materials to replace the existing ones in the market, but simply to plant a seed of thought.\\

**ChatGPT said:**

Thatâ€™s a refreshing perspectiveâ€”focusing on storytelling and awareness rather than prescribing solutions. Hereâ€™s my next question:

4\. What form will your project take? Will it be a publication, an exhibition, a digital platform, a series of workshops, or something else?



**You said:**

In my head, its a mix of these things, maybe a series of workshops to encourage hands on experiences, maybe a digital platform to understand traceability of materials, maybe a sensorial exhibition which allows viewers to interact with the exhibits. Im still trying to figure it out

**ChatGPT said:**

That makes senseâ€”it sounds like the project could evolve in multiple directions based on how people engage with it. Hereâ€™s my final question:

5\. What kind of impact do you hope your project will have in the short and long term?



**You said:**

in the short term, since there's a lot of discussion happening around anti capitalism, my research could be a way to have a dialogue about being immersed in the process, slowing down and using resources responsibly. And in the long term, I wish to start a collective back in my country, India with fellow artists and designers focused on similar ideologies. The dream would be to host artist residencies, which focus of material awareness as a practice and create a space for similar dialogue. This also goes hand in hand with conservation, of heritage, local crafts as well as vernacular architecture and practices

**ChatGPT said:**

Thatâ€™s an inspiring vision! Now, based on everything youâ€™ve shared, hereâ€™s a concise and compelling project definition:

***

**Project Definition**

In a world where materials are often seen as mere tools for mass production, this project seeks to reframe our relationship with themâ€”exploring their geography, history, cultural context, and lifecycle. Rather than focusing on the end product, it emphasizes the beauty of process, imperfection, and the deeply embedded narratives within materials.

Starting with designers but expanding to anyone interested in material consciousness, this initiative aims to spark curiosity and dialogue rather than prescribe solutions. It does not advocate for specific sustainable alternatives but instead encourages a mindful, immersive approach to material useâ€”one that appreciates origin, craft, and the human touch.

The project could take multiple forms, from hands-on workshops that foster direct engagement with materials to digital platforms that enhance traceability and awareness. Sensorial exhibitions could also invite audiences to experience materials in new ways, deepening their understanding of their intrinsic value beyond function.

In the short term, this project aligns with the growing discourse around anti-capitalism and responsible resource use, advocating for slowness and appreciation in a fast-paced, production-driven world. In the long term, it aspires to evolve into a collective in Indiaâ€”an artist residency and collaborative space dedicated to material awareness, conservation, and dialogue around heritage, local crafts, and vernacular practices.

Ultimately, this is a project about storytellingâ€”using materials as a lens to explore culture, history, and human connection.

Does this definition feel aligned with your vision? Would you like any refinements?



**You said:**

sounds good



**ChatGPT said:**

Great! Now, letâ€™s refine your projectâ€™s purpose using Simon Sinekâ€™s Golden Circle framework. Weâ€™ll start with What your project does.

1\. If you had to describe your projectâ€™s core activity in one sentence, what would it be?



**You said:**

using materials as a tool to understand history, culture and heritage

**ChatGPT said:**

Perfect! Now, letâ€™s explore How your project achieves this.

2\. What are the key methods or approaches you use to bring this idea to life? (e.g., workshops, storytelling, sensory experiences, digital tools, collaborations, etc.)



**You said:**

workshops, sensorial exhibitions, collectives

**ChatGPT said:**

Great! Now, letâ€™s dig into Why your project exists.

3\. What deeper belief or motivation drives you to do this work? Why is it important to you personally?



**You said:**

I really love to do hands on things with materials, i am deeply interested in local arts crafts and heritages. I believe these are the things that give objects an identity - how its made, who makes it, how much effort goes into it, etc. Its the practice and stories of practice that makes an object invaluable in terms of its heritage. Apart from this, I believe exploring the process of making things also is a powerful way to understand the ethics and philosophies that shape our lives as consumers and people

**ChatGPT said:**

Thatâ€™s a strong and deeply personal motivation! Now, letâ€™s put it all together using the Golden Circle framework:

***

**The Golden Circle of Your Project**

ðŸ”¹ Why â€“ This project exists because the way objects are madeâ€”their materials, processes, and cultural significanceâ€”holds invaluable stories about history, heritage, and identity. By exploring how things are crafted, we gain a deeper understanding of the ethics, philosophies, and relationships that shape our world as both consumers and creators. Hands-on engagement with materials is not just a method but a way to slow down, appreciate, and reconnect with craft, culture, and sustainability.

ðŸ”¹ How â€“ The project achieves this through immersive experiences such as workshops, sensorial exhibitions, and creative collectives. These formats allow people to engage with materials directly, explore their histories, and reflect on the beauty of process over product.

ðŸ”¹ What â€“ At its core, this project uses materials as a tool to understand history, culture, and heritageâ€”sparking curiosity and dialogue around craftsmanship, sustainability, and the deeper meaning behind the things we make and use.
