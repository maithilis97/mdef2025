# Intervention 02 : Experimentation with clay

As my second intervention, I wanted to interact with the clay which I had sourced two weeks back, as a way to investigate the similarities and differences in the material.&#x20;

Drying process :&#x20;

After processing the clay, I left it out to dry naturally. It took around a week and a half. I kept checking until it was almost dry. At one point, it looked like pure chocolate :)

Excited to experiment with it!

### Temper&#x20;

To make the clay usable and to even out the drying process without cracking, 20% sand has to be added to the clay before making objects.&#x20;

### Experimentation Plan&#x20;

1. 1/3  Clay without temper : To understand the behaviour of clay without additives
2. 2/3 Clay with temper&#x20;
3. 3/3 Clay with Semolina as temper : Adding mycelium to test if temper can become food for mycelium
