# Living Materials

Faculty : Petra Garajova, Wetlab and S-Biotica

***

### Day One : Petra Garajova&#x20;

First day of the seminar started with a lecture by Petra, explaining the basics of biomaterials. She went over the theory of how materials are crafted, supported by samples of crafted biomaterials for us to interact with. After discussing theory in detail, she led the class to an hands on demo session, where she demonstrated the way of 'cooking' these materials. &#x20;

As part of the assignment, we had to create our own biomaterials - one crafted and one living.&#x20;

### Day : Wetlab, Hangar

On the second day, we had the opportunity to visit Hangar, and specifically the Wetlab. Artist Ce Quimera presented their work, including _transplanta_, a project that explores transhackfeminism through the integration of living organisms and biotechnologies. The WetLab fosters critical discussions on the intersections of biology, technology, and identity, promoting methodologies centered on care, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing between human and non-human entities.

### Day 3 : S-Biotica | Lara Campos, Jessica Dias

S-biotica Studio, a Barcelona-based collaborative initiative by former IAAC students Lara Campos and Jessica Dias, explores the intersection of biomaterials, science, and design. Their work integrated biological collaborators like mycelium, algae, and waste materials. Through biomaterial research, educational workshops, and transdisciplinary collaborations, S-biotica promotes sustainable and circular design practices that challenge conventional perceptions of materials.
