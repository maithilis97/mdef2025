# Research Questions and Framework

As part of my project, I am trying to explore a few questions which become the core of the project.

1. How can we understand the embedded narratives of history, culture and local practices that materials carry within them ?
2. How does being a part of the making process influence our relationship with things ?&#x20;
3. Looking at materials as more than resources, can we reimagine our interactions with objects/built form?



#### Proposed Hypothesis&#x20;

Material Memory explores materials as vessels of history, culture, and human touch, moving beyond their role in mass production to uncover their origins, lifecycle, and deeper narratives. Through hands-on making, storytelling, and sensory engagement, the project highlights the imperfections, labor, and traditions embedded in materialsâ€”fostering awareness and dialogue rather than prescribing solutions.

#### Theoretical Framework

The projects aim to take to bottom up approach, by using the micro scale of materials to learn about the biggers scales of practice, community, culture and heritage. It aims to make the process of interacting with materials accessible, and in turn rebrand the way we envision the use of them.
