# Alternative Present Exercise

In pairs, we interacted with our peers about our projects while trying to define our present continuities and present alternatives. Auxence and I worked together and we asked each other a series of questions about our projects, as a way of helping us clarify our narratives.&#x20;

People like myself, with an interest in design, interact with materials and objects without taking into account the history and heritage of them. Industrial mass production has alienated and impersonalised the context in which materials are used, the availability of them locally and the immersion in the process of making due to lack of knowledge, and the correct resources.

People like myself, with an interest in design, interact with materials and objects with an awareness of where they come from. People learn to opt for local materials, taking into account the local heritage and give equal importance to the process of making objects and using materials with an intention to create meaningful things, thanks to initiatives that provide education and resources.
