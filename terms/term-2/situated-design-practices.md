Faculty : Saul Baeza

### &#x20;Day 01 : Visit to Cal Negra&#x20;

On the first day of the seminar, we visited Hospitalet de Llobregat, the delta region where there's a juxtaposition of diverse territories - the El Prat airport, a nature reserve, the Llobregat delta and finally the beach.  In the morning, we visited a farmhouse which is occupied by artists who practice on the farm. Maria, one of the artists living there,  works with ceramics and uses local clays around the area for her practice. I found the approach fascinating and I had the chance to talk with her about m y research. We later went to a neighboring farm to get some freshly harvested vegetables, we we met Jauma. He explained to us the history of the river, the original and the changed path of the Llobregat river and its effects. He went on to elaborate about the politics of the area, proposed expansion of the airport and the impact it would have on the surrounding fields.&#x20;

We also had the chance to meet with a falconer whose falcons work for the airport. It was a fascinating discussion about interspecies collaboration, which ties a lot into what we have been discussing in class throughout the term. &#x20;

We spent the rest of the day day cycling around the area, visited various locations in the nature reserve which had either a historical significance or geographical vantage point. Saul, along with some more faculty members, explained us the contextual history and the stories behind the places we visited. The weather was absolutely perfect, and cycling around was refreshing.&#x20;
